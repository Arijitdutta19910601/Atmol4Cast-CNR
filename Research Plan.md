# Research Plan for Stay

## Title

### Probabilistic Data Driven Causality Inferencing and Graphical Neural Network based Forecasting.

## Participant Info

### Name: Arijit Dutta
### Affiliation: University of Calabria & ISAC-CNR Lamezia Terme
### Primary Supervisor(s): Prof. Dr. Floriano De Rango and Dr. Claudia Roberta Calidonna
### Supervisor in Host Institute: Dr. Irene Schicker

## Objectives / Goals

### [Onshore & Offshore Data] -> [Preprocessing & Lag Features] -> [Probabilistic Causal Graphs] -> [Causal Inference: Who affects whom?] -> [GNN-based / Traditional Forecasting] -> [Comparison of Results with NWP]

## Context and Alignment

How the visitorâ€™s expertise connects with the host activities/projects.

## Structure by Time (usually by month or phase)

### Month 1: Orientation, literature, data familiarization
#### Week 1: Spent time diving into relevant literature regarding forecasting techniques. According to the suggestions, the focus is also on AD, ETS, and CRPS implementation details.
#### Week 2:

### Month 2: Method development, prototyping

### Month 3: Testing, application, documentation

## Deliverables / Outputs

Scripts, datasets, notebooks, reports, presentations, or publications.

## Optional Additions

Expected meetings or collaborations

## Learning outcomes

Integration with ongoing EU/industry/national projects
