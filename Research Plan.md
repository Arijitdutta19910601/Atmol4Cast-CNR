# Research Plan for Stay

## Study and Design of Data Collection & Forecasting System for Wind Energy Potential Discovery and Forecasting

### Probabilistic Data Driven Causality Inferencing and Graphical Neural Network based Forecasting.

## Participant Info

### Name: Arijit Dutta
### Affiliation: University of Calabria & ISAC-CNR Lamezia Terme
### Primary Supervisor(s): Prof. Dr. Floriano De Rango and Dr. Claudia Roberta Calidonna
### Supervisor in Host Institute: Dr. Irene Schicker
### This project is jointly funded by Tech4You-CNR (Identification Code: ECS_00000009 | CUP: H23C22000370006), which comes under the scheme National Recovery and Resilience Planning (PNRR), Government of Italy, under the Next Generation EU (NGEU) instrument.

## Objectives / Goals

### [Onshore & Offshore Data] -> [Preprocessing & Lag Features] -> [Probabilistic Causal Graphs] -> [Causal Inference: Who affects whom?] -> [GNN-based / Traditional Forecasting] -> [Comparison of Results with NWP]

## Context and Alignment

### The previous projects of the Atmol4Cast-REN group of Geosphere Austria have profound experience and relevant evidence in Wind Data Forecasting. The projects, such as MEDEA, SSEA, Wind4Future, and WINDSOR, are some of the work they have done extensively on wind speed and energy forecasting for short-term and nowcasting. 

## Structure by Time (usually by month or phase)

### Month 1: Orientation, literature, data familiarization
#### Week 1: Spent time diving into relevant literature regarding forecasting techniques. According to the suggestions, the focus is also on AD, ETS, and CRPS implementation details.
#### Week 2:

### Month 2: Method development, prototyping

### Month 3: Testing, application, documentation

## Deliverables / Outputs

Scripts, datasets, notebooks, reports, presentations, or publications.

## Optional Additions

Expected meetings or collaborations

## Learning outcomes
