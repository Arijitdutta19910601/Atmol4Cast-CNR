The wind velocity data were acquired from the onshore mid-precision weather sensors at the three locations in Calabria. Forecasting for the short Term (24 to 48 hours).
Stochastic probabilistic techniques like Bayesian networks and Granger causality-based probabilistic graphical models development, and then using Graphical Neural Networks / Hidden Markov Model to process the data for Forecasting.
