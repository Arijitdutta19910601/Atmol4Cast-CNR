# Research Plan for stay

Topic:
- The wind velocity data were acquired from the onshore mid-precision weather sensors at the three locations in Calabria. (Can be point and spatial)
- Forecasting for the short Term (24 to 48 hours). Frequency: 5/10 minutes forecast frequency.
- Stochastic probabilistic techniques like Bayesian networks and Granger causality-based probabilistic graphical models development, and then using Graphical Neural Networks / Hidden Markov Model to process the data for Forecasting.


Steps:
1. Data: create a data inventory (including co-variates)
2. Method: make it modular
3. Verification: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/we.2497, E
