#### [Onshore & Offshore Data] 
####    ↓
#### [Preprocessing (Alignment, Cleaning, Normalization) & Feature Engineering (Lag Features, ETS Decomposition)]
####    ↓
#### [Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) Learning]
####    ↓
#### [Probabilistic Causal Graphs (Inferred Temporal-Causal Structure)]
####    ↓

####    ↓
#### [DCRNN (Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) or STGCN (Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network)]
####    ↓
#### [Anomaly Detection Head (optional: via prediction uncertainty or classification)]
####    ↓
#### [Probabilistic Forecasting (Wind Speed Distributions) OR Traditional Deterministic Forecasting]
####    ↓
#### [Evaluation Metrics: CRPS, Brier Score, Reliability Diagrams, ROC Curves and AUC]
####    ↓
#### [Comparison with Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Models (e.g., WRF, ECMWF forecasts)]


## Context and Alignment

#### The previous projects of the Atmol4Cast-REN group of Geosphere Austria have profound experience and relevant evidence in Wind Data Forecasting. The projects, such as MEDEA, SSEA, Wind4Future, and WINDSOR, are some of the work they have done extensively on wind speed and energy forecasting for short-term and nowcasting. 

## Structure by Time (usually by month or phase)

### Month 1: Orientation, literature, data familiarization
#### Week 1: Spent time diving into relevant literature regarding forecasting techniques. According to the suggestions, the focus is also on AD, ETS, and CRPS implementation details.
#### Week 2:

### Month 2: Method development, prototyping

### Month 3: Testing, application, documentation

## Deliverables / Outputs

#### Platform: A seamless tool for wind energy forecasting visualisation which collects wind data from heterogenous sources (Lidar, Meteo Mast, ATLAS, models etc.) harmonise preporcess and provide detailed analysis. The comparison between these model should provide the novel architecture's edge over other existing.

#### Publications: At least one reputed Q1 journal article.
